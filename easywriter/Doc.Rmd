### How does it work?

Just start typing your phrase and the Easywriter will suggest you plausible next words as follows:

* Given your input so far, three most likely continuations are displayed.

* If you are currently typing a word, it helps you to complete the word. 

* If you have just finished typing a whole word, that is, **if your phrase ends by a space**, then it suggests you full next words.

* Just click on the correct suggestion to add it to what you are writing !
